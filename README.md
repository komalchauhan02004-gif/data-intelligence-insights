# Data Intelligence Insights

## Overview
This project is an advanced, multi-level data analysis initiative focused on extracting meaningful and actionable insights from a real-world restaurant dataset.  
Rather than limiting the work to basic exploratory analysis, the project emphasizes structured problem-solving, relationship analysis, and insight-driven decision support using Python.

---

## Project Objectives
- Perform structured analysis across multiple difficulty levels
- Identify patterns, correlations, and trends within the data
- Apply analytical thinking beyond basic visualization
- Generate insights that can support data-driven decisions

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes detailed restaurant-level information such as:
- Restaurant name and city
- Cuisine types and combinations
- Ratings and votes
- Price range
- Online delivery and table booking availability
- Geographic coordinates (latitude & longitude)
- Customer reviews (text data)

---

## Analysis Levels & Tasks

### LEVEL 1: Foundational Analysis
- Identified the most common cuisines and their distribution
- Performed city-wise analysis of restaurant count and average ratings
- Analyzed price range distribution across restaurants
- Compared ratings based on online delivery availability

---

### LEVEL 2: Pattern & Relationship Analysis
- Explored common cuisine combinations and their impact on ratings
- Conducted geographic analysis using latitude and longitude data
- Identified restaurant chains and analyzed their performance and popularity

---

### LEVEL 3: Advanced Insight Generation
- Performed text-based analysis on customer reviews to extract key sentiment indicators
- Analyzed voting patterns and their correlation with ratings
- Studied the relationship between price range and service availability

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Learnings
- Structured multi-level analysis improves insight quality
- Combining numerical, categorical, and text data enhances understanding
- Real-world datasets require both analytical and logical problem-solving
- Data-driven insights are more valuable than isolated metrics
